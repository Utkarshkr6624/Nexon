"""Role-based authorisation: the vocabulary and the role → permission map.

Design decision
---------------
Permissions live in a Python map, not in a ``roles``/``permissions`` join table.
The role set is tiny and fixed — ``user`` and ``admin`` — and it is chosen in
this file, not by an operator at runtime. A table would buy runtime mutability
we have no use for and would cost a query on every protected request, plus a
class of bug where the database says one thing and the code assumes another.
When the role set stops being fixed (per-tenant roles, custom roles, delegated
scopes) this map is the only thing that has to change: the call sites already
ask for a :class:`Permission`, never for a role.

Every lookup here is fail-closed. :func:`permissions_for` returns an empty set
for an unrecognised role instead of raising, because a role value that drifted
out of step with this module is a *data* problem, and raising on every
protected endpoint would turn it into a 500 for every user. Doing nothing is
the correct degraded behaviour: the request is denied, the incident is visible,
and nobody's working session breaks.

#: What each role may do. Read-only access is the baseline for every role;
#: writes are an explicit grant, never an accident of ordering.
#:
#: ``user`` holds ``users.write`` because every account must be able to edit
#: its own profile and change its own password. That grant is scoped by
#: ownership, not by the permission: the router compares the target id against
#: the authenticated subject and rejects anything else. Withholding the
#: permission instead would not be safer, only invisible — a self-service
#: profile edit would need a bespoke exception path that bypasses this map
#: anyway, and the one thing the map is for (a readable answer to "what may an
#: ordinary user do?") would become "everything except the thing they most
#: obviously need".
#:
#: Phase 4 grants ``user`` BOTH calendar permissions. The alternative — a
#: read-only calendar for ordinary users — was considered and rejected on the
#: same grounds as ``users.write`` above: a personal planner whose owner cannot
#: book a meeting is not a planner, and the planner is the feature. Withholding
#: the grant would not be safer, only broken, because the calendar is *per user*
#: and every write is ownership-scoped in the query rather than in this map: a
#: ``calendar.write`` holder can only ever touch rows carrying the caller's own
#: ``owner_id``. The permission that would matter here is trust in that filter,
#: which every other write in the system already extends.
#:
#: Phase 5 grants ``user`` BOTH knowledge permissions for exactly the same
#: reason. Notes, concepts, resources, bookmarks, documents, categories and
#: knowledge links are all per-user, and every read in
#: :mod:`app.services.knowledge_service` carries ``owner_id`` in its ``WHERE``
#: clause — including the polymorphic link endpoints, which have no foreign key
#: and are therefore resolved through an owner-scoped lookup *before* an edge is
#: written. The grant is a statement about the feature existing, not a statement
#: that this map enforces the isolation.
#:
#: **``tests/test_permissions.py`` asserts both the full member set and the full
#: ``user`` grant as literal sets, so it must be extended with these two
#: members or it will fail.** Flagged here because a red test is otherwise easy
#: to misread as a regression in this file.
